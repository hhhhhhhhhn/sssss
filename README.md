# sssss - simple static site setting software

sssss is a small compiler, which makes it easier to display the changes in javascript variables. reactive variables start with an "@" symbol. To see a small example, check out the [first test html](./test/index.html) and [javascript](./test/index.js) files.

## usage
```
sssss HTML_FILE OUT_DIRECTORY
```

javascript files are taken into account automatically. all javascript must be deferred.

## todo
- make the templates work in html attributes
- option to escape templates
